## Ingredients
1  pouch (1 lb 1.5 oz) Betty Crocker™ sugar cookie mix
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 package (8 oz) cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 egg
1 1/4 cups apple pie filling with more fruit, chopped (from 21-oz can)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 350°F. Grease 9-inch glass pie plate with shortening.
2. In large bowl, stir together cookie mix and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Add 1/2 cup softened butter; mix with pastry blender or fork until crumbly. Press half (about 2 cups) of the crumbly mixture in bottom and up side of pie plate. Bake 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon melted butter to remaining crumbly mixture; toss to combine. In medium bowl, beat cream cheese with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add sugar and flour; blend well. Add vanilla and egg; beat until smooth. In another small bowl, mix apple pie filling and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.
4. Spread cream cheese mixture in cookie crust. Spoon apple pie filling over cream cheese mixture. Distribute crumbly mixture over top of pie.
5. Bake 33 to 38 minutes or until top of pie is golden brown. Cool 1 hour. Refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving. Cover and refrigerate any remaining pie.
