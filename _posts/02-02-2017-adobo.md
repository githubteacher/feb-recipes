Ingredients

- 4 to 5 pounds chicken thighs

- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 3 bay leaves

Directions

1. Combine the chicken thighs, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaves in a large pot. Cover and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours.
