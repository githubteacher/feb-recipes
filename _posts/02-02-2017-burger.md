## Ingredients
- egg
- 1 teaspoon mustard (regular or Dijon)
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 small onion, finely grated
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1⁄2 teaspoon salt
- 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
- 1 lb medium ground beef

## Directions
1. Lightly oil grill& heat BBQ to medium.
1. Whisk egg in a bowl& add next 6 ingredients.
1. Add any of the “stir-ins” that appeal to you.
1. Crumble in beef& using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.
1. Handle the meat as little as possible – the more you work it, the tougher it gets.
1. Gently shape (don’t firmly press) mixture into burgers about ¾ inch thick.
1. Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.
1. Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6 – 8 minutes per side.
1. An instant read thermometer should read 160F.
1. Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!
1. Tuck into a warm crusty bun& add your favourite toppings.
