![](http://foodnetwork.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2004/1/12/0/ckwks_WK1A10_blueberrypncks.jpg.rend.sni12col.landscape.jpeg)

### Ingredients
* 1 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 eggs
* 1 cups buttermilk
* 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter, plus some for frying
* 1 cup blueberries, fresh or frozen

### Directions
In a large bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

Beat the eggs with the buttermilk and melted butter. Combine the dry and the wet ingredients into a lumpy batter, being careful not to over mix.

Heat some butter in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon 1/3 cup of batter into the skillet and sprinkle the top with some of the blueberries. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.

Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and maple syrup.
