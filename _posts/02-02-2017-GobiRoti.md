## Directions


Use a large, deep pan. Melt 1 TBS butter in the hot pan, then add all chopped/sliced mushrooms and stew for about 10 minutes.
Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and add parsley.
In a different saucier or pan melt last 2 TBS of butter, and stir flour into the melted butter. Continue to stir until smooth. Pour wine and broth into flour mixture and bring to boil, continually stirring for several minutes.
